\noindent\instruction{This is a template for practical 1, all text in
  blue and the pseudocode example may be removed. The report may have
  at most 6 pages in the current format. The current sections and
  subsections must be present in the report, additional subsections may
  be added. Additionally, you may add examples, figures or pseudocode
snippets (see Algorithm~\ref{pseudocode}).}

\section{Explanation of the Algorithm}
\subsection{Initialization}
\instruction{How do you read in the data and initialize the required
data structures?}

\subsection{Algorithm Logic}
\instruction{Explain what your approach is, and what the algorithm
  does. Explain which data structures did you use and why. In case
  you adapt existing algorithms, explain how and why you modified and
incorporated it.}

\begin{algorithm}[h!]
  \caption{Pseudocode example.}
  \label{pseudocode}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Function{Function}{arguments}
    \State Step 1
    \While{Condition 1 does not hold} F
    \If{Condition 2}
    \State \Return Yes
    \Else
    \State Step 2
    \EndIf
    \EndWhile
    \State \Return No
    \EndFunction
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Returning the Answer}
\instruction{When does the algorithm terminate and what is returned?}

\subsection{Optimizations}
\instruction{Did you use any special tricks to make the algorithm
faster in special cases based on the problem statement?}

\section{Correctness Analysis}
\instruction{Why is your algorithm correct? Provide precise
  arguments, supported by formal reasoning whenever needed. Think of an
  expanation to a critical colleague why your algorithm is correct. For
  examples, take a look at correctness proofs in the textbook
(Algorithms Illuminated) or solutions to the weekly exercises.}

\section{Complexity Analysis}
\instruction{What is the big O complexity of your algorithm
  (including reading in the data and making the data structure)? The
  analysis should be written in terms of the given input parameters.
  For example, if the input includes sets $V$ of vertices and $E$ of
  edges the complexity analysis should result in a big-Oh complexity
using $V$ and $E$. Include an explanation of your answer.}

\section{Reflection}
\instruction{Briefly reflect on the project. For example, you can
  write about how easy it was to find a suitable algorithm? Or if your
  algorithm is not always correct on DOMjudge, why do you think you get
wrong answers? Or if there are of additional ways to speed up the algorithm?}
